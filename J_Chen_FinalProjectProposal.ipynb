    "Yeshiva University is currently in the quiet phase of a \\\\$650 million capital campaign which will span 8 fiscal years.  Typically, an organization announces a fundraising campaign to the public when they are about half way to their goal. The University has already laid the ground work for securing large gifts from some of our best donors.  Many of these donors plan to make large gifts at the beginning of the campaign, but as the campaign continues on, it can be hard to garner support when we have already asked our most loyal supporters for gifts.  By providing appropriate data analytics now, Yeshiva University can begin to cultivate donors that may not currently be on our radar so that they can help us close out the final years of the campaign and hit our goal of \\\\$650 million.

    "First, we want to find out if a person will donate or not. Once we find our potential donors (classified as 1), what will be the amount of their donation?  Nonprofit organizations run on donations and serve to further a good cause. In the case of Yeshiva University, donations will serve to further advance the University so that it can provide a valuable secondary school experience to all of its students. Approaching people that are more likely to donate will save time and generate more revenue for the University to use towards scholarships, professorships, building renovations, and capital improvements."
